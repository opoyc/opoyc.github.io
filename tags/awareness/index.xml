      <description>This afternoon I was reading a book about rationality in voting behavior called “An economic theory of political action in a democracy”(Downs 1957). An amazing work (so far), for sure I do not discard that it’s likely I’ve a biased position regarding the application and precision of rational models in economics. However, what impressed me was authors’ self-awareness of the underlying flaws behind rational analysis in decision making, and not covering them like they do not exist in a book from 1957!</description>
