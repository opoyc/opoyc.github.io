      <description>For every researcher there is that moment when we question ourself of how much our findings could hold if we relax one or more assumptions. Specially in economics where we breath and eat regressions.
Robust statistics is a set of procedures that aim to provide near ideal estimates even if some of the assumptions in which the estimation method relies are not met. Particularly, a robust regression represents an alternative to least square estimations that is less susceptible to the existance of “data contamination”, that is, influential points (outliers or leverage) that are unlikely to match a normal distribution.</description>
