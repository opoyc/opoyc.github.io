      <description>Recently, I have been playing with vector autoregressive models. During the model specification and “sanity checks” one has to choose model order, that is, how many LHS lags introduce in the multi-equation model.
The most common approach for lag order selection is to inspect among different information criteria and choose the model that minimizes these indicators. There are several Information Criterion alternatives, and they vary on the weight they put on prediction error and parameters.</description>
